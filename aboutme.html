  <h2>Leisure</h2>
    <p><img src="../Images/IMG_1895.jpg" alt="Dog" class="img1895">
     I enjoy having free time to spend on my hobbies such as sports, biking, hiking and playing video games.
   I enjoy going on long walks with my dog Ollie through trails, dogparks, or even just around the block. Living in
   the Niagara Region, I have access to the Niagara Falls, Niagara River, the Niagara escarpment and other amazing views
   that make going for walks so enjoyable. However, when I want to speed things up, I hop on my bike and hit the trails.
   This is a hobby I have gotten into recently since the sports that I used to play have stopped running. I will however
   take the time to throw a frisbee at any chance I get as I love playing ultimate frisbee and even played on the varsity
   team at Brock University. When I want to take things light, I enjoy playing video games to pass the time.</p>

  <h2>Professional Experiences</h2>
    <p><img src="../Images/IMG_1845.jpg" alt="River" class="img1845">
     My professional experiences do not make up a very long list but I see them as very valuable for the
   direction I want to be heading when it comes to a career. I recently graducated from Brock University
   where I studied Geography and was first exposed to working with Geographic Information Systems (GIS).
   I developed a passion for it and have worked in the public and private sectors working with GIS and have enjoyed all of it.
   The experiences I had allowed me to work in an office and in the field, making it a dream job of mine as I love to get outdoors.
   I am currently continuing my education in GIS applications at Fleming College and I am excited to see where I go from here. </p>
